<h3>Review</h3>
<pre>Green monster seem to be all the rage these days, what with Hulk,
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QPNlmiT.png" style="float:left;">Yoda, and that big ugly troll thingy out of the first Harry Potter
movie. But Shrek, the flatulent swamp-dwelling ogre witha a heart of
gold (well, silver at least), is more than capable of riwalling any
of them.
In Shreck 2 Antonio Benderas plays a skwashbukling performance as
puss in boots, a cat that can talk! and apart from that is an incredible fighter.
